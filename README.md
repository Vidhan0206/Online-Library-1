# 📚 Online-Library

**Online-Library** is a simple Java program created as part of my learning journey in Java. It simulates the core features of a real-world library system and demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in action.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new books to the library
- Display available books
- Borrow and return books
- Track borrowed books
- Basic command-line interface for interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (Core Java)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to:

* Practice Java syntax and OOP concepts
* Simulate a real-world application
* Build a foundation for more complex Java projects

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

* Understanding class relationships (e.g., Library and Book)
* Encapsulation and modular code design
* Basic error handling in Java
* Working with collections (e.g., ArrayList)

## 📃 License

This project is open-source and free to use. Add a license if you need one (e.g., MIT, Apache).

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This was a self-learning project. Thanks to various Java tutorials and documentation that helped me understand the basics!
